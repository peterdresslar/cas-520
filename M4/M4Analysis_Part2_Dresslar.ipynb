    "As we mention in the previous section, the Altruism model is a more \"abstract\" model. Therefore, it seems that an appropriate route for sensitivity analysis (SA) would be to start with a One at A Time (OAT) SA, as recommended by Figure 3 in LZ 2020. Note that here we have selected a simpler OAT rather than an One Factor At a Time--we are stepping through all of the parameters at regular intevals (see in the ranges below) rather than using random intervals. We do this with the intent to better understand the model and choose a next analysis.\n",

    "As requested in the assignment, we are exploring the (altruism) cost, (altruism) benefit, disease, and harshness parameters of the model. Our currency is the populations of \"altruists\" and \"selfish\" at the completion of the model. We might note that a specific model behavior is the collapse and extinction of one of the populations at a certain point, and that the duration of resilience of one group or the other that becomes extinct might be a useful secondary measure: for instance, we might class a run in which the altruists reach zero population in 20 ticks to be different from a run in which they do so at tick 2000. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, for our OAT testing, weʻll attempt to explore that factor just to understand the parameter settings at which lengthy meaningful runs are possible. To do this, our model is modified to stop on the tick when either altruists of selfish reach zero population, and we set up a very large maximum ticks value in order to account for long (within practical reason) duration runs. At certain starting parameters, the model can stay quite dynamic, with both populations swapping positions of advantgae multiple times, even for thousands of ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our runs are set up again using `pynetlogo`, this time working with a separate module that contains the running code for convenience. The experimental harness code has changed very little from our previous notebook and the M2 module assignment, with the exception that it has been designed to be possible to stop and start from a checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pynetlogo` code will sweep the designated parameters listed in the codeblock above. Note that `altuistic_probability` and `selfish_probability` are left at their defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for `runs_per_node`, first it should be explained that we call a multi-paramater settings point on our 4x5 matrix (formed using the ranges) a \"multi-parameter node\" or \"node.\" Since this is an exploration the decision has been made to simply always perform as many runs as practically possible given time constraints. 10 runs per \"node\" seem sufficient, and we will mark in our analysis parameter settings for which there were multiple \"outcomes\" within the nodes."

    "These data should now be ready, in particular our currency values \"altruists_mean\" and \"selfish_mean\", for analysis. We might use graphics to start. To do this, it should be possible to focus on two of the parameters at a time to create 3D plots. Since our altruists and selfish values are mostly reciprocal, we can simplify things by visualizing how parameters yield altruists_mean. We can use `cost_` vs `benefit_` for one of the plots, and `disease` vs. `harshness` for the other. For our plots, we will coalesce the relevant means into single node \"steps\" for each variable explored."

    "These charts are somewhat as expected--of course, low costs of altruism and high benefit yield more altruists, though it would appear that the costs are more important. While all the values of altruism are low in our disease versus harshness plot, we might note that high degrees of each, as expected, cause a low number of altruists to last. This behavior is predicted by the model author. We might also observe a tiny bump on the plot, perhaps where we would expect it from manual operation of the model, at harshness and disease of 0.8. This is expected as some higher values of the pair do lead to more favorable conditions for altruism (as mentioned in the model notes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible next step would be more runs focused on that bump. From manual OAT probing on the modelʻs UI, that parameter \"neighborhood\" is very sensitive to change. It might also be noted that it seems that the other variables are somewhat \"swamping\" our Disease-Harshness view overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are at a point where we have some visibility to the system, we might switch over to the methods mentioned in Kwakkel (2017). That writeup indicates the use of of [SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a possibility for a similarly abstract model, and we should be able to adapt our data to work with the approach. We should be able to try both `altruists_mean` and `selfish_mean` as our currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do most of the processing in our `pynetlogo_utils` module, but here, we can set up our problem and our (new) Sobel sampling pass, which will be more random."
