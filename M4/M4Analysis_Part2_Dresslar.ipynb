    "As we mention in the previous section, the Altruism model is a more \"abstract\" model. Therefore, it seems that an appropriate route for sensitivity analysis (SA) would be to start with a One at A Time (OAT) SA, as recommended by Figure 3 in LZ 2020. Note that here we have selected a simpler OAT rather than an One Factor At a Time--we are stepping through all of the parameters at regular intevals (see in the ranges below) rather than using random intervals. We do this with the intent to better understand the model and choose a next analysis.\n",

    "As requested in the assignment, we are exploring the (altruism) cost, (altruism) benefit, disease, and harshness parameters of the model. Our currency is the populations of \"altruists\" and \"selfish\" at the completion of the model. We might note that a specific model behavior is the collapse and extinction of one of the populations at a certain point, and that the duration of resilience of one group or the other that becomes extinct might be a useful secondary measure: for instance, we might class a run in which the altruists reach zero population in 20 ticks to be different from a run in which they do so at tick 2000. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, for our OAT testing, we ªll attempt to explore that factor just to understand the parameter settings at which lengthy meaningful runs are possible. To do this, our model is modified to stop on the tick when either altruists of selfish reach zero population, and we set up a very large maximum ticks value in order to account for long (within practical reason) duration runs. At certain starting parameters, the model can stay quite dynamic, with both populations swapping positions of advantgae multiple times, even for thousands of ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our runs are set up again using `pynetlogo`, this time working with a separate module that contains the running code for convenience. The experimental harness code has changed very little from our previous notebook and the M2 module assignment, with the exception that it has been designed to be possible to stop and start from a checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pynetlogo` code will sweep the designated parameters listed in the codeblock above. Note that `altuistic_probability` and `selfish_probability` are left at their defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for `runs_per_node`, first it should be explained that we call a multi-paramater settings point on our 4x5 matrix (formed using the ranges) a \"multi-parameter node\" or \"node.\" Since this is an exploration the decision has been made to simply always perform as many runs as practically possible given time constraints. 10 runs per \"node\" seem sufficient, and we will mark in our analysis parameter settings for which there were multiple \"outcomes\" within the nodes."
