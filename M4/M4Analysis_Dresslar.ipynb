    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The NetLogo model, \"Altruism\" (Wilensky 1998), ships as a Agent Based Model that can be evaluated in the NetLogo computational framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents in the context of agent based models are model elements that might have properties and/or state information. We might loosely define properties as immutable data relating to the agents, and state as mutable date relating to the agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents can be operated on individually or in batches--the latter being inferrable by the former--using computational rules. NetLogo operates with different agent \"classes\" and can be operated with many different evaluation settings, but for our discussion we will assume that the salient features of the agents in the Altruism model are that they are called \"patches\" in the NetLogo implementation framework, and that each individual agent is assigned a \"location\" in a two-dimensional network which it shares with all the other agents. Out of the box, the graph of the network is a 41 x 41 grid, filled completely with 1,681 patch agents, with operations wrapping both horizontally and vertically across the edges of the grid. Patches, once assigned to a location in the network with x and y coordinates, do not move: that is to say, the containers of state do not change in order of the grid. All agents in the NetLogo Altruism model have access to all properties and state values of all other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents of Altruism operate within a domain with (in the base model) six assignable parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `altruistic-probability`\n",
    "- `selfish-probability`\n",
    "- `cost-of-altruism`\n",
    "- `benefit-from-altruism`\n",
    "- `disease`\n",
    "- `harshness`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these parameters is defined as a variable containing a floating point value. We call these domain parameters since they apply to all elements within the model (and are accessible to all elements within the model), and they are set independently of the modelʻs operation. The parameters can be set by the end-user of the model through user interface controls; these controls restrict the parameters to ranges between 0 and .5 < limit 1, inclusive. It might be noted that these restrictions could be overridden arbitrarily in code or even by an ambitious end-user; they might be seen as range *recommendations*. Importantly, it might also be noted that the values can be reset at anytime of the modelʻs operation; this is a much more complex operational envelope that we will ignore for the purposes of this exercise. We will instead limit our investigation to model executions with unchanging domain parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the base model, Altruism endows each agent with the same state variables. In other words, while the agents of Altruism can be heterogenous with respect to state values, they are monotonic in terms of state variable (by virtue of being defined once globally) definitions. Outside of graph position (and some trivial technical settings; see below) the Altruism are monotonic with respect to properties; by virtue of being \"patches\" in NetLogo, they all behave identically under identical conditions (with the exception of operations dependent on their network properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, we must mention the `pcolor` property of NetLogo agents. This is another built-in property that controls the visual color display of the agents, including patches---this would seem to be a trivial technical setting in other contexts. However, since NetLogo lacks enumerated typing, the `pcolor` property is often appropriated by developers to assign meaningful states, frequently ones that class groups of agents in some way or ways. Thus, while most technical settings would never be used to alter data directly, `pcolor` often becomes a fundamental aspect of the modelʻs operation.[^1] is entirely the case with Altruism. So, we will treat `pcolor` as a an agent property that is defined by the implementation but *re-defined* by the developer as an agent state variable. [^2]\n",

    "That this variable is called once per step and used for the assignment of the pcolor/benefit-out compound variable makes it critical to the design of the model. It is an interesting implementation choice to leave it effectively as a population-wide variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "All initial state assignments are applied one at a time, in a sequence executed by the randomizing `ask patches` command. We will discuss the stochastic nature of the command below; however, in the context of initial state assignment, the order in which assignment occurs for individual agents does not appear to make a difference to execution outcomes, and it seems likely that there is generalizable assertion about models along those lines.ʻ\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Agent Population-Level Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In many NetLogo models, much of the \"point\" of the model is the temporaly-situated proportionate existance and state of the agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is certainly true for Altruism, whose primary point of model \"interest\" is the survival of the classes (`pcolor`s) of agents. A secondary point would be those survival rates taken at specific model time points. (e.g., do the altruists die out quickly? slowly?) A tertiary interest point would be the rates of change as the model executes, and whether equilibria or other complex phenomena are exhibited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The counts of agents by `pcolor` by time step are thus important model variables, but they are handled implicitly. The user interface implemented for Altruism displays both current and historical counts of patches by `pcolor`, but these are generated programmatically rather than stored as declared state variables. Netlogo handles model-wide groupings of agents through the Agentset class, which contains the count function as well as any other implicit variables for the populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is mysterious. The NetLogo ticks model stands in as a compehensible approximation of discrete causally-ordered steps, with causal order in the direction congruous with the arrow of time. Individual agent updates further divide these ticks into additional causally-ordered steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intra-model stochasicity and inter-agent setting (Step 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Place variable network diagram here\n",
    "\n",
    "### About `ask-patches`\n",
    "\n",
    "Possibly the most stochastic element model of all is a hidden one: the `ask patches` command. Used for all of specific agent updates in the model, `ask patches` by default selects all the patch agents, one at a time, in a random order. This randomness, for some models, would not make a difference at all---the order of operation on inidvidual patches that are all generally the same and operating indepently would be the same in any other. However, in Altruism, patches not only interact, but their physical proximity to their network neighbors is critical. Therefore, we might expect that there could be some difference in processing behavior even for different distributions of randomness (`ask patches`, apparently, uses a normal random distribution.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the impact of this effect, a modified version of the model has been developed at M4Model_Dresslar_modified.nlogo. The modified version contains sort-ordered major processing commands for benefit and fitness checking, plus the lottery. This model can be compared with the model at M4Model_Dresslar_base.nlogo. Both have expanded telemetry functions to measure the application of altruism throughout the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* each model has also been modified to halt on the extinction of pink or green patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following runs, we take the default domain settings and modify `disease` and `harshness` to 0.66 for each value. This is a known semi-stable starting condition."
