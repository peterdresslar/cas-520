    "### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The modification adds a small feature allowing the user to control additional (approximately) random link-generation with a toggle and sliders. The new controls are located under the grid display. New code is located in a block demarcated with my name. Further information about the modification appears below. There is a more detailed description of the behavior at the bottom of this page. I have intentionally placed it there in case the reviewer might prefer to evaluate the model before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "I was unable to get the `nw` extension to work at all with my setup. Instead, I added a very basic display for `links-per-node`. A also borrowed this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```netlogo\n",
    "if not plot? [ stop ]\n",
    "let max-degree max [count link-neighbors] of turtles\n",
    "plot-pen-reset  ;; erase what we plotted before\n",
    "set-plot-x-range 1 (max-degree + 1)  ;; + 1 to make room for the width of the last bar\n",
    "histogram [count link-neighbors] of turtles\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...from the library model, Preferential Attachment, to generate a histogram plot of the network Degree Distribution. These plots are particularly sensitive to activity from the customization mentioned in Step 1, since additional links can be added over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be imagined, an increase in the frequency of new link generation not only causes the `links-per-node` summary statistic to grow larger, it also causes our general degree of connectedness to be higher. While I do not think the current model evaluates outcomes based upon link degree classes, it might be interesting to consider how virology might treat such extended relationships, perhaps by thinking about whether specific mutation chances would rise based upon those network measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "From the supplied images, it appears CV stabilizes at around 100-200 runs for both the susceptable and resistant currencies. I observe that the included \"BehaviorSpace\" setup has this number at 100, and so we will use that run-number for our experiment (called \"Planes\" in the .nlogo file.) Weʻll expect to use those same currencies, though we might also peak in on \"dead\" (survival) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given variables for BehaviorSpace from the March10 experiment were:\n",

    "### Step 3 Analysis\n",

    "We can now load and review the data we have using, to start, pandas for dataframe grouping and analysis."

Along the way, any nodes within `plane-radius` of the plane are connected to *every other node* the plane has already come into contact with, following the linking rules of the base model (for instance, \"dead\" nodes are not linked). Higher values of `plane-radius` can thus generate very large numbers of network connections.\n",
