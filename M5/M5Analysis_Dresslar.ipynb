    "Step 1: First Analysis – Choose a Parameter to Explore\n",

    "This model has over a dozen important parameters that a user can modify in order to bring about change in the model. From these parameters, choose two parameters to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "fission-energy, farm-cost, fertility-loss, fertility-restore, bad-years\n",
    "Independently of one another, pick high medium and low values of a parameter and run the model for 500 max_cycles (6 total runs). Be aware that there are a number of outputs, and the different petameters may impact some but not others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe which parameters you chose to study and which values you chose.\n",
    "How did the value impact the overall simulation?\n",
    "Were there different spatial patterns or did the trends in the graphs change?\n",
    "Does your parameter affect the vegetation types on the landscape?\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have an unparalleled ability to adapt to new situations and try different solutions to problems. Now you will adjust the model to reflect that. Your task is to add random variation to the properties of new households. These new parameters may ultimately affect the success of new households.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Be sure to add comments to indicate what code you have added (e.g. ;added by SB)\n",

    "2.1.  Add an On/Off Switch to the interface to control if random variation will occur, and add a slider to control the frequency of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2.  We are only adding variation to descendent household agents. Identify where new households are created in the code (Hint: look for the word Hatch). Modify this code to create new households based on your switch and random chance (your slider).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3. Choose 2 of these 4 variables used in the code tab (technically set in the Interface with a different name) to change randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "fission-rate, farm-dist, min-fertility, move-rate\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4. If a new strategy is chosen, also change the household color randomly. This way we might see that one color becomes more common, or dies out quickly and can visually assess the changes that are occurring (Hint: remember that color can be specified by words or numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have completed the above correctly, the switch should produce a model with all red households if ‘OFF’ and multiple colors if ‘ON.’ Households should now become more or less successful based on the new values that they are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of new and dynamic behavior can add a lot to a simulation, including things to analyze. A full analysis of this adaptive capacity would take too long. Run your model for 1000 max_steps (if it stops beforehand that’s ok).\n",
    "\n",
    "How much variation is there in strategies  (this should be visible from the different colors that are visible)?\n",
    "What types of mutations (different values from step 2.3.) seem to be the most successful?\n",
    "Remember that you can right click on an agent and inspect the household to see what values it is using."

    "\n",
    "Iʻm most interested in finding breakpoints where the model is barely stable so that we can best \"test\" the fitness of our agents. For starters, we observe that the base values of the sliders in `Farming.nlogo` are:\n",
    "```\n",
    " `init-households`: 2.0\n",
    " `harvest`: 12.0\n",
    " `fission-energy`: 150.0\n",
    " `init-move-threshold`: 50.0\n",
    " `swidden-radius`: 12.0\n",
    " `farm-cost`: 3.0\n",
    " `tree-clearing-cost`: 3.0\n",
    " `move-cost`: 2.0\n",
    " `fertility-loss`: 20.0\n",
    " `fertility-restore`: 2.0\n",
    " `bad-years`: 20.0\n",
    " `max-fallow`: 20.0\n",
    " `transfer-ownership`: false\n",
    " `max_cycles`: 500.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our variables to test are: fission-energy, farm-cost, fertility-loss, fertility-restore, bad-years. Weʻll keep the rest static for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manual OAT observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that `bad-years` just dampens farming returns all the time. Its primary impact is on households/farmstead (total farmsteads appears to be almost purely a function of swidden radius); it adds as a \"carrying capacity\" modifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might observe that `farm-cost` also does this, though it also influences decision making to a small degree. It is also exteremely harsh at high numbers. At 9.0 `farm-cost`, the system outcome is not deterministic and some runs fail to obtain stability before crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "`fission-energy` does not have a strong systemic impact on model outcomes on its own, though it could be imagined to be more important in our later inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `fertility-restore` is 0, any positive `fertility-loss` will result in a system crash eventually.  However, even at 1 percent, `fertility-restore` can successfully salvage stable system outcomes for any positive value of `fertility-loss` within scale. In doing this, `fertility-loss` dampens total returns and energy in a manner similar to what is seen with higher `bad-years` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, letʻs take a look at some systemic runs with `farm-cost` and `fertility-loss` using BehaviorSpace. Weʻll be using some of the same code I turned in for next weekʻs assignment, last week. Long story.\n"

However, `farm-cost` does not have a strong impact on vegetation quality, and in fact the impact it does have seems likely to be an outcome of simply compressing the total number of households and reducing the \"field\" to its natural state (when `farm-cost` is raised.)\n",

    "As expected, the count_households values here are higher than they are in the \"no behavior\" (randos? = false) version of the model listed above. This confirms the outcome seen in manual runs of the model where the \"randomization\" of behavior tends to always result in a rise of households that otherwise would be static without such behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `farm-dist` (`swidden-radius`) always increases from 12.0 over a run and tends to land, fairly reliably, around 17, with some variation depending on `farm-cost`. This is a major correction in value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `min-fertility` tends to drop, but appears to be quite sensitive to `farm-cost`. We might also observe that the standard deviation on these statistics are quite low.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `move-threshhold` (`init-move-threshhold`) tends to drop a bit over time from 50, again in a way that is somewhat sensitive to `farm-cost`. A little bit of agression seems to be rewarded in lavish conditions, perhaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fission-rate` tends to stay static for `farm-cost` of 3.0 or 5.0. This might be the most interesting observation of the four! More intense analysis might investigate whether `fission-rate` is simply not enough of a determinant to survival to be selected for (this seems likely), or if there isnʻt some indirect pressure from other variables stabilizing the `fission-rate` regardless of the other changes in the model. However, something very interesting happens when `farm-cost` is 8.0. For the runs that actually survive, `fission-rate` is very high. (To confirm this see the quartile analysis.) Could higher fission rates make households more survivable in harsh conditions? Households perhaps only multiply in situations where energy is sufficient for the offspring to survive? (And could this effect be \"swamped\" in lower-difficulty `farm-cost` settings?) This seems like a reasonable reading, but many more fine-grained runs would be useful to confirm (along with sensitivity analysis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we might note that `mean_vegetation` does slowly decline over time in seeming lockstep with rising households. This is what we would expect: with more households, the land can be used (or, depending how you look at it, exploited) more efficiently, leading to a condition that may not be stable in the extremely long horizon.
