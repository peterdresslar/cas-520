    "Step 1: First Analysis – Choose a Parameter to Explore\n",

    "This model has over a dozen important parameters that a user can modify in order to bring about change in the model. From these parameters, choose two parameters to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "fission-energy, farm-cost, fertility-loss, fertility-restore, bad-years\n",
    "Independently of one another, pick high medium and low values of a parameter and run the model for 500 max_cycles (6 total runs). Be aware that there are a number of outputs, and the different petameters may impact some but not others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe which parameters you chose to study and which values you chose.\n",
    "How did the value impact the overall simulation?\n",
    "Were there different spatial patterns or did the trends in the graphs change?\n",
    "Does your parameter affect the vegetation types on the landscape?\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have an unparalleled ability to adapt to new situations and try different solutions to problems. Now you will adjust the model to reflect that. Your task is to add random variation to the properties of new households. These new parameters may ultimately affect the success of new households.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "*Be sure to add comments to indicate what code you have added (e.g. ;added by SB)\n",

    "\n",
    "2.1.  Add an On/Off Switch to the interface to control if random variation will occur, and add a slider to control the frequency of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2.  We are only adding variation to descendent household agents. Identify where new households are created in the code (Hint: look for the word Hatch). Modify this code to create new households based on your switch and random chance (your slider).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3. Choose 2 of these 4 variables used in the code tab (technically set in the Interface with a different name) to change randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "fission-rate, farm-dist, min-fertility, move-rate\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4. If a new strategy is chosen, also change the household color randomly. This way we might see that one color becomes more common, or dies out quickly and can visually assess the changes that are occurring (Hint: remember that color can be specified by words or numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have completed the above correctly, the switch should produce a model with all red households if ‘OFF’ and multiple colors if ‘ON.’ Households should now become more or less successful based on the new values that they are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of new and dynamic behavior can add a lot to a simulation, including things to analyze. A full analysis of this adaptive capacity would take too long. Run your model for 1000 max_steps (if it stops beforehand that’s ok).\n",
    "\n",
    "How much variation is there in strategies  (this should be visible from the different colors that are visible)?\n",
    "What types of mutations (different values from step 2.3.) seem to be the most successful?\n",
    "Remember that you can right click on an agent and inspect the household to see what values it is using."

    "Iʻm most interested in finding breakpoints where the model is barely stable so that we can best \"test\" the fitness of our agents. For starters, we observe that the base values of the sliders in `Farming.nlogo` are:\n",
    "```\n",
    " `init-households`: 2.0\n",
    " `harvest`: 12.0\n",

    " `move-cost`: 2.0\n",
    " `fertility-loss`: 20.0\n",
    " `fertility-restore`: 2.0\n",
    " `bad-years`: 20.0\n",
    " `tree-clearing-cost`: 3.0\n",
    " `max-fallow`: 20.0\n",
    " `transfer-ownership`: false\n",
    " `max_cycles`: 500.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our variables to test are: fission-energy, farm-cost, fertility-loss, fertility-restore, bad-years. Weʻll keep the rest static for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Manual OAT observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that `bad-years` just dampens farming returns all the time. Its primary impact is on households/farmstead (total farmsteads appears to be almost purely a function of swidden radius); it adds as a \"carrying capacity\" modifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might observe that `farm-cost` also does this, though it also influences decision making to a small degree. It is also exteremely harsh at high numbers. At 9.0 `farm-cost`, the system outcome is not deterministic and some runs fail to obtain stability before crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "`fission-energy` does not have a strong systemic impact on model outcomes on its own, though it could be imagined to be more important in our later inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `fertility-restore` is 0, any positive `fertility-loss` will result in a system crash eventually.  However, even at 1 percent, `fertility-restore` can successfully salvage stable system outcomes for any positive value of `fertility-loss` within scale. In doing this, `fertility-loss` dampens total returns and energy in a manner similar to what is seen with higher `bad-years` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, letʻs take a look at some systemic runs with `farm-cost` and `fertility-loss` using BehaviorSpace. Weʻll be using some of the same code I turned in for next weekʻs assignment, last week. Long story.\n"

We can see the associated impacts on the numbers of `unused` patches, which are so set upon a house dissolution. However, `farm-cost` does not have a strong impact on vegetation quality, and in fact the impact it does have seems likely to be an outcome of simply compressing the total number of households and reducing the \"field\" to its natural state (when `farm-cost` is raised.)\n",

While it does indeed somewhat impact the \"carrying capacity\" of the land with respect to household-per-farmstead, it has a stronger impace in particular on fertility and vegetation quality.
