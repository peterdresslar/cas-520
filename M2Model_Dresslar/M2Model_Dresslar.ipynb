    "For this assignment we will use [pynetlogo](https://pynetlogo.readthedocs.io/) to capture and report simulation outputs. An excellent and relevant example appears [here](https://pynetlogo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_docs/introduction.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important** pynetlogo will apparently only work reliably with NetLogo 6.3.0. While that presents challenges of its own, it is also important to note the the model we are using, `segregation`, *must* have a version number that matches that version of NetLogo. So, grabbing the latest version of the model may not work without tweaking the file. The model with adjusted version number is in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pynetlogo` requires a Java install, for which I used `brew install cask temurin` (on Apple silicon). While the jvm path can be overridden, it appears that pynetlogo ªs implementation of JPype works to automatially find the installed JVM from that cask. Note that I wound up having to point to the `app` directory within the Netlogo base installation.\n",
