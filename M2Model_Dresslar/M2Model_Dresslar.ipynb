    "*CAS 520, Peter Dresslar*\n",

    "For this assignment we will use [pynetlogo](https://pynetlogo.readthedocs.io/) to capture and report simulation outputs. An excellent and relevant example appears [here](https://pynetlogo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_docs/introduction.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important** pynetlogo will apparently only work reliably with NetLogo 6.3.0. While that presents challenges of its own, it is also important to note the the model we are using, `segregation`, *must* have a version number that matches that version of NetLogo. So, grabbing the latest version of the model may not work without tweaking the file. The model with adjusted version number is in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pynetlogo` requires a Java install, for which I used `brew install cask temurin` (on Apple silicon). While the jvm path can be overridden, it appears that pynetlogo ªs implementation of JPype works to automatially find the installed JVM from that cask. Note that I wound up having to point to the `app` directory within the Netlogo base installation.\n",

    "## Step 1: First Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 1: Set density to 80% and similarity wanted to 30% and run the simulation several times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 2: Keeping density at 80%, change the similarity threshold to 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 3: While the model is still running from step 2, slowly move the similarity slider to the left and note when the model behaviour changes and segregation emerges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 4: Rerun the simulation a few times with 80% density and similarity threshold at the tipping point you discovered."
