    "Purpose\n",
    "This assignment will have you practicing both model analysis and model coding with the CA-based Segregation Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is in Netlogo and found at File --> Models Library --> Sample Models --> Social Science --> Segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start this project as soon as possible, coding often takes longer than one expects!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to ask your fellow students for aid using the Discussions section in Canvas.\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 1: First Analysis\n",
    "Perform the Procedurefollowing experiments with the Schelling Segregation model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 1: Set density to 80% and similarity wanted to 30% and run the simulation several times. Record the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The average average similarity.\n",
    "The average time to total happiness.\n",
    "What else to you notice about the world view? Number of orange and blue clusters? The edges of clusters? Are any clusters embedded in other clusters? Curved or straight boundaries?\n",
    "Experiment 2: Keeping density at 80%, change the similarity threshold to 90%. Record the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The average average similarity.\n",
    "The time to total happiness, if any.\n",
    "Experiment 3: While the model is still running from step 2, slowly move the similarity slider to the left and note when the model behaviour changes and segregation emerges. Record the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is that percentage?\n",
    "What does that percentage mean in terms of similar neighbors?\n",
    "Experiment 4: Rerun the simulation a few times with 80% density and similarity threshold at the tipping point you discovered. Record the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The average average similarity\n",
    "The time to total happiness.\n",
    "What else to you notice about the world view compared to the observations from Step 1? Number of orange and blue clusters? The edges of clusters? Are any clusters embedded in other clusters? Curved or straight boundaries?\n",
    "Step 2: Coding\n",
    "To make the model more realistic, it's unlikely that an unhappy turtle will move to a patch where it knows that it would also be unhappy. Change the unhappy turtle behavior so that instead of moving to a random unoccupied patch, the turtle makes a single move to a patch where it will be happy, and if no such patches exist, the turtle stays put.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment your code notating any changes from the original model, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    ";MODIFIED 3 lines to change the patch color\n",
    "For this coding exercise, you will likely need a reporter. A netlogo reporter is instructions for computing a value, which then ‘reports’ to whoever asked it. It's like a procedure, but instead of using to we use to-report. Like a procedure, there in also an end. The procedure exits when the report command is used within the reporter, which returns the value of the calculation to the asking entity. A reporter will usually also have an input, which is often some value that is used in the reporter calculation. In general the format for a reporter is\n",

    "end\n",
    "This reporter could be called by\n",
    "\n",
    "ask turtles [ print circle-area size / 2 ]\n",
    "which will ask each each turtle to print an area value using half its size and the circle-area reporter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a turtle is asking a patch to compute a value using one of the turtle's variables, you will need to use the myself primitive. Here's a boolean patch reporter that compares the turtle size with the patch size. \n",
